Phishing URL Detection ML
This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at detecting phishing URLs, leveraging various URL structural and content-based features.

âœ… Whatâ€™s covered in the current work:

- Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate Analysis (feature-wise histograms, KDE plots & box plots)
- Outlier Detection & Handling (IQR capping)
- Class Distribution Visualization
- Feature Scaling (Standardization & Minâ€“Max Normalization)

ðŸ§  Dataset Features:
Includes structural and content-based URL characteristics such as URL length, domain properties, special characters, and page metadata.

ðŸ“Š Libraries Used:
Pandas â€¢ NumPy â€¢ Seaborn â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ Scikit-learn
